## Hi there 👋 My name is Mason
📫 Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-ballard/)

I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology from Florida State University. 

I have professional work experience in the public and private sector doing data analytics, data science, dashboarding, report generation, database management, project management, software development, technical writing, cross-functional planning and coordination, and more. 

Some of favorite and preferred programming languages include:
- 🐍 Python
- 🐬 SQL
- 🤖 C#
<br>

🌱 I am currently learning about:
- AI and LLMs (specifically implementation in Python), and integration into other software applications
<br>

🔭 I recently learned about:
- web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- building web applications in Python (Flask, Bootstrap, SQLite)
- building cross-platform applications in .NET (C#, .NET MAUI, Blazor Hybrid)
  - using Microsoft.ClearScript.V8 V8ScriptEngine to run Javascript in C# .NET applications
- using Google Cloud Platform, a Google cloud project, and a Google application API to automate tasks utilizing Google applications

#### Highlight 🎞️ Reel - Short descriptions of the pinned projects on my Github and my most interesting lessons learned:
- 🎵 this-sounds-like: A Python Flask web scraping appication that uses Genius.com to gather credits for songs and albums
  - the `BeautifulSoup` module for web scraping or parsing HTML and XML sources
  - you can use `opencv-python` and `numpy` to average colors - shout out to [Tim Poulsin's 2018 blog post](https://www.timpoulsen.com/2018/finding-the-dominant-colors-of-an-image.html) for this
    - I used this to dynamically render page styles (in CSS) to match album artwork
- 🦝 TrashThiefApplications: Made as part of a group project for a software engineering class, this will go down as one of the coolest projects I got to work on. The repo features our 2D platformer game made using C# and Unity.
  - From drawing the main avatar character, sourcing other elements, understanding how games can be coded and programming navigation, to discovering a robust online game dev community, creating and delivering distributable executables of a software project for Windows, Mac, and WebGL, this project was such a fun learning experience.
  - Such a great example of just how much you can accomplish when you allow curiosity to drive you. A cool experience in just how much software development can be an exercise in creativity.
- 🛒 TheHappyMiniMarket: A mobile application made with .NET, C#, and an ASP.NET Core Web API
  - A great introduction to the .NET ecosystem and the Microsoft community - shout out to James Montemagno's YT channel for getting me through this project
- 🚗 Effective-Electric-Vehicles: A group research term paper written for a data science course. Long title: "Measuring the Effectiveness of Electric Vehicles based on Environmental Impact, Cost-Effectiveness, and Reliability"
  - A satisfying culmination of exercising skills accrued in LaTex, Overleaf, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL + MySQL
  - Great experience utilizing and demonstrating lessons learned using matplotlib and scikit-learn to create visualizations, aggregate data, and utilize various predictive analysis tools to gather insights and support conclusions as part of research.
- ⚛️ PQC-Standardization-Report: A research paper on NIST's PQC standardization process
  - An interesting dive into recent work at NIST. Got to understand post-quantum cryptography, its importance, and just how standards are iteratively selected and standardized thanks to whitepapers, publicly available FIPs papers, and public posted presentations and conference/summit sessions and recordings.
  - A great way for me to get insight into the governance that surrounds the ever moving and changing technological world and its impact on small everyday things to infrastructure security.
- 🎧 SocialSounds: A web application built as part of a group project written primarily in Python
  - Helped understand web applications as a concept and their implementation
  - Learning to implement and utilize APIs and how powerful they can be
  - Storing and creating a standardized process for storing, modifying, and displaying unique and variable data in strucutre systems like databases and predefined or (more) strictly typed data structures

#### ⚡Certifications:
- CompTIA A+ , Network+, Security+, July 7, 2025 - 2028
- GIAC GPYC (GIAC Python Coder), May 14, 2025 - 2029
